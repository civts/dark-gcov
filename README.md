## ‚ùì What this is

This a simple CSS theme for the reports generated with the `genhtml` command from the [lcov utility](https://github.com/linux-test-project/lcov).  
The aim is to give a nice makeover to the original UI.

## üîß Usage

Just download a copy of the [gcov.css file](https://github.com/civts/dark-gcov/blob/master/gcov.css). At this point you are pretty much set and can choose to either

- Run the command `genhtml -c ./path/to/gcov.css` to generate a new report with the new theme.
- Replace the `gcov.css` file in an existing report.
